###What are the causes of a banking failure?

Now we know a bit more about the functions of a bank and how it works, it is easier to explain what the causes of a banking failure are. Of course there is not a single cause of a failure, often a combination of different factors play a role in explaining why a banking failure happened. 

As seen in the previous sector, banks receive surplus money from people who do not need it at the moment (deposits) and loan this money to people who do need it (loans). This function of the bank is also where problems tend to exist. The maturity of a bank's liabilities are often shorter than the maturity of its assets. Deposits are often short term and can be withdrawn by customers at any moment. Loans on the other hand are long term, think about mortgages for example. All kinds of mismatching problems then start to develop. If either the assets drop in value or deposits are withdrawn at a massive rate, the bank will fail.
